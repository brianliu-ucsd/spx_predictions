# SPX Prediction Model

The ML model was created using a Keras implementation of a LSTM, and is designed to predict tick-by-tick prices of the SPX index.

The model was trained on large tick-by-tick datasets gotten from SierraChart, and tested on both live and delayed data from Interactive Brokers.
